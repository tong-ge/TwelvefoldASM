# BlahajASM
The Blahaj are now preparing to bytecode manipulate your game. >w<

BlahajASM is a fork that removes the "questionable" content of [L**iASM/CensoredASM](https://github.com/LoliKingdom/LoliASM) by Rongmario licensed LGPLv2.1

While FermiumASM makes some good changes, it sacrifices by requiring using FermiumBooter which can cause issues with cleanroom ~~and i dont like FermiumASM changeing the dependencies~~

As with the original, BlahajASM makes multiple improvements, optimizations, and bug fixes to Minecraft, including but not limited to:

-   Optimizing RAM usage, especially in larger packs.
-   Fixing multiple crashes, in Minecraft, Forge, and some other mods.
-   Multiple performance improvements.
-   Crash handling to allow you directly upload crash reports to [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/).

Significant changes from CensoredASM:
- Removed built-in Spark profiling as it is both incompatible with, and superseded by, the updated fork Spark Unforged
- Rebranded user-facing and logging branding to BlahajASM
- Removed chance to pick and blame a random author in a crash
- Updated mcmod.info to add fork author (me >w<), update url, and change icon

As with the original, BlahajASM is incompatible with VanillaFix and TexFix as their functionalities have been improved and added directly to the mod.

Due to the changes made in this mod, if you have any issues, please report them to the linked issue tracker at the top for [BlahajASM](https://github.com/valiray/BlahajASM/issues), not the original mod.
